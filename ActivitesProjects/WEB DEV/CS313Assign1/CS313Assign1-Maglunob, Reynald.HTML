            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            <p>Molly had been staring out of their window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature, New Scientrist</i>, and all thge other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she needed to be free.
      </p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde qoute proclaming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.</q> Although many consider her pioneering work, unraveling thye secrets of the Ilama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do. </p>
